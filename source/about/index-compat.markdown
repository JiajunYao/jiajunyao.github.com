Welcome to here! My name is Jiajun Yao (姚嘉俊) and you can call me Jerome. Now I'm working at a startup Qiduo Inc. as a server-side and Android developer. I graduated from Software Institute, Nanjing University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree. I love computers and strive to become a hacker and a startupper.
