Welcome to here! My name is Jiajun Yao (姚嘉俊). Now I'm a master student at School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University and I graduated from Software Institute, Nanjing University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree. After graduation I worked at a startup Qiduo Inc., as a server-side and Android developer, for one year.

I love computers and strive to become a hacker and a startupper. Now I'm interested in the big data and mobile technologies.
